[/sw] /Users/wwxu/software/autoconf/fink-0.45.1
In what additional directory should Fink look for downloaded tarballs? (use the absolute pathname only) [] /Users/wwxu/software/autoconf/fink-0.45.1
Which directory (absolute pathname) should Fink use to build packages? (If you don't know what this means, it is safe to leave it at its
default.) [] /Users/wwxu/software/autoconf/fink-0.45.1

Your current build directory '/Users/wwxu/software/autoconf/fink-0.45.1' will be indexed by Spotlight, which can make packages build quite
slowly.

Would you like to use '/Users/wwxu/software/autoconf/fink-0.45.1.build' as your new build directory, so that Spotlight will not index it? [Y/n] Y
